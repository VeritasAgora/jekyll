### There's nothing here — yet.

(Maybe you'll be the one to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8NdNjysTQwEDnJdd4Q2CSbtALlg7cetoYo8pLOYUeHh7VFg/viewform" target="_blank">write it</a>)

*Do not go gentle into that good night,*  
*Old age should burn and rave at close of day;*  
*Rage, rage against the dying of the light.*  

*Though wise men at their end know dark is right,*  
*Because their words had forked no lightning they*  
*Do not go gentle into that good night.*  

*Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright*  
*Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,*  
*Rage, rage against the dying of the light.* 

*Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,*  
*And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,*  
*Do not go gentle into that good night.*  

*Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight*  
*Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,*  
*Rage, rage against the dying of the light.*  

*And you, my father, there on the sad height,*  
*Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.*  
*Do not go gentle into that good night.*  
*Rage, rage against the dying of the light.*
